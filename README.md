Huddle is a web-application inspired by Meetup. Huddle is a platform that promotes a community of users to plan, host, and attend events catered to their personal interests. Whether professional, informal, or just for fun, we believe that people should have a means to get to know each other if they are interested in similar things. Find your huddle and share your love of something with others who feel the same way.
